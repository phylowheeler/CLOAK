Directory containing methods to generate and evaluate amino acid substitution models trained on filtered multiple sequence alignments.

### Model Training
Amino Acid substitution models were trained using Qmaker, implemented in [iqtree2](http://www.iqtree.org/) as described [here](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Estimating-amino-acid-substitution-models#estimating-a-model-from-a-single-concatenated-alignment)
